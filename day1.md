# Day 1

This list represents the Calories of the food carried by five Elves:

In case the Elves get hungry and need extra snacks, they need to know which Elf to ask: they'd like to know how many Calories are being carried by the Elf carrying the _most_ Calories.

Find the Elf carrying the most Calories. _How many total Calories is that Elf carrying?_

#### --- Part Two ---

By the time you calculate the answer to the Elves' question, they've already realized that the Elf carrying the most Calories of food might eventually _run out of snacks_.

To avoid this unacceptable situation, the Elves would instead like to know the total Calories carried by the _top three_ Elves carrying the most Calories. That way, even if one of those Elves runs out of snacks, they still have two backups.

Find the top three Elves carrying the most Calories. _How many Calories are those Elves carrying in total?_
